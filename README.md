# Space-Invada Description
###### ENGR 105 Final Project - Stroke rehabilitation robotic device which helps improve wrist function through video games


This is the project Nicha Thongtanakul and I came up with in which we made a  Co-lead a robotic design project which improved the grip function of stroke patients by creating a pressure-based end- effector that allowed them to play our customized version of ‘Space Invaders’ that scales with their motor function. This will allow the patient to continue rehabilitating themselves as their grip function improves. We implemented this at the Mona Rehabilitation Center in my hometown Kingston, Jamaica :green_heart::black_heart::yellow_heart:. This project was very special to me as I was already able to give back to Jamaica!
